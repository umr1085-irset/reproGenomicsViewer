                <h2>What is the ReproGenomics Viewer?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The ReproGenomics Viewer (RGV) is a multi- and cross-species genomic database for the visualization, mining and comparison of published omics data sets for the reproductive science community.
                    It was developed to assist scientists in the mining of a wide range of ultra-high-throughput reprogenomics data, including RNA and DNA sequencing data.
                    RGV allows hosting, visualization, and direct comparison of usersâ€™ data to published genomics studies as well as to relevant genetic variations linked to reproduction.
                    The ReproGenomics Viewer database currently hosts several landmark datasets in the field of reproductive biology from several model organisms.
                    Data sets have been curated, processed and conveniently organized into several categories including biological topics, technologies, species and publications.
                    These standardized data analysis procedures within the reproductive science community greatly facilitate comparisons of data sets.</p>

                <h2>Why should I submit my highthroughput data to the ReproGenomics Viewer?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Considerable worries have recently been raised regarding the lack of reproducibility of biomedical research.
                    Funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), share this concern and discuss ways to enhance reproducibility by notably providing greater transparency of the data.
                    Journals and public funding agencies have thus begun to make public availability of raw data but also analyzed data a condition of publication or funding, respectively.<br>
                    In addition, we believe that it is also a matter of give and take, so to speak as making reprogenomics data available to the community:<br>
                    1- it will facilitate data comparison and the development of innovative tools;<br>
                    2- and, on the other hand, it will make your reprogenomics studies and publications more visible (as investigators will be able to compare their own data with yours) and it will thus boost citations of your scientific articles.</p>

                <h2>Is the ReproGenomics Viewer database intended to replace existing resources?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Of course it isn't! RGV neither intends to archive raw data such as GEO, nor to replace existing reprogenomics resources.
                    Instead, it aims at complementing them by acting as a distribution hub in which scientists can actively submit and share their highthroughput data with the community.</p>

                <h2>Future developments and perspectives</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In the near future we will extend the scope of the RGV to keep pace with rapid technological, bioinformatics/genomic and biological/clinical advances in the reproductive sciences.
                    In concrete terms, we are currently planning four separate actions:<br>
                    1- we will gather other relevant data sets from a wide range of species in RGV to cover other reproductive biological topics. In this context, we encourage data submission from colleagues.<br>
                    2- we will be adding other genetic information related to reproductive disorders (such as GWAS and Quantitative trait loci information from diverse sources and diverse model organisms).<br>
                    3- we plan to develop community tools that will greatly facilitate collaborative work and stimulate the emergence of novel forms of collaboration in our research field.<br></p>
